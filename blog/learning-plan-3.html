          <p>Coming from a privileged background, I have never been forced to consciously cultivate a counter to the major stressors befalling others. Whilst it‚Äôs important to take note of and count my blessings, when stress does I am starting off less equipped than some. My own response can be overwhelming, and the fight, flight, or freeze reactions sometimes take over - adding to the vicious cycle of stressing about stress.   </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>The main instigator is social. When I feel a conversation isn't being heard or communicated clearly the boiling point begins to lower. I‚Äôm glad both Patch & Joseph mentioned external factors being useful when attempting to declaw the catalysts for stress response. My own experience mirrors theirs. The most recent example was as simple as a fellow student noticing I was <em>‚Äòin the code‚Äô</em> and offering a glass of water. Potentially more useful though, was a piece of advice offered by my father that I still carry nearly two decades later. </p>

          <p>It was a busy public holiday and I was working front of house, alongside Dad, in my parents restaurant. There was a queue out the door, long waits on food, and I could sense a general angst rising in the room. Attempting to pre-empt the complaints I increased my pace but doing too much at once, grew scattered. Meanwhile my father was cool as a ü•í</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Even though the profits might slip my boss was telling me to relax. A decade later I had my own restaurant and on busy days I heard the same advice echo in my head. Whilst now it was my money the <em>‚Äòque, ser√°, ser√°‚Äô</em> attitude in which the original words were delivered had become the figurative meaning. I was reminded of these words when Joseph talked about reframing. Years later, the quote has lost all literal meaning and is just a reminder that stressing can‚Äôt help the stressful.</p>
