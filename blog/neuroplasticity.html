          <p>Neuroplasticity is the capacity to change neural networks in your brain through growth and reorganisation. Much like a well-used thoroughfare a neuronal desire path can adapt into a highway through unintentional habit or, more importantly, intentional repetition. Not only can we practise to increase the traffic flow to these neuronal connections, but by understanding the principals of neuroplasticity we can become our own city planners. </p>

          <p>Surprisingly, simply educating students about a brains capacity to change allowed them to excel over control-group peers. Piano players simply told to <em>imagine</em> practising for a week became more proficient players and muscle groups strengthened when participants of one study were told to <em>imagine</em> working out. </p>

          <p>If one has confidence in their capacity to change, then negative self-talk can be countered. When challenged, I will tell myself <em>“It’s okay to suck”</em>. I will put new information into context. Whilst I have traditionally struggled with learning from readings, or lectures, I can work to my strengths by inventing my own stretch challenges. In doing so, I can contextualise our learning competencies by putting them into practise.</p>

          <p>Firstly, through challenge and novelty. Cognitive change can only be achieved when trying something new-to-you. To do so, one must practise repeated and directed attention towards a desired change. Shorter, high intensity bouts are usually needed to create any new connections. That said, be conscious of time. Be patient with yourself. Plan for lapses – they’re normal – refocus, adjust your schedule, but most importantly, keep going.</p>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Not dissimilar from neuroplasticity in practise, a growth mindset represents the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems just by framing them correctly. </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Where a fixed mind might avoid difficult challenges, see effort as fruitless and feel threatened by the success of peers; a growth mindset is more likely to embrace that same level of challenge, find inspiration in others and think of effort as the path to mastery.  Saying, or just thinking, “I love a challenge” or “not yet” can lead to general grit, as well as completely different neuro chemistry - potentially even <b>changing IQ levels.</b> </p>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Whilst the piano and muscle examples are indeed surprising the benefits can also be seen generally. The growth mindset simply embraces the perseverance necessary to acquire new skills whether physical, or cerebral. </p>

          <p>I think I can best apply the lessons of a growth mentality in countering self-criticism. I often say, “I have a black belt in beating myself up”. With the assistance of a therapist, we have been practising saying “I’m still learning to” rather than “I am not good at” although in just three weeks I’ve already been susceptible to the woes a fixed mindset.  When stuck, rather than seek help I fell into a trap Carole Dweck identified in her book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset" target="_blank">Mindset, The New Psychology of Success:</a> </p>

          <p>When Dweck’s grade school students mentioned “I love a challenge” they performed better. I do to love a challenge and will lean into the learning style that I enjoy most – acquisition of new skills through practical expression. In my learning plan I already hinted at some of the conclusions of Dweck’s work. I am aware that I will fester rather than reach out for help. In employing a growth mindset, I can reframe what feels like an innate aversion as a twisted knot of neurons, yes, but with the possibility of being unpicked. There is another way of thinking: </p>
