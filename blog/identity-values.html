          <p>I was raised a Catholic by my parents, two half-hearted atheists who were told that was the "right" way to raise kids. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I was born and grew up in (mostly rural) VIC, Australia but we moved around a lot. I attended 6 primary schools in 7 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>My Dad, a Kiwi, and my mother being British and an overstayer I was considered a “Citizen of the Realm”, not achieving citizenship of any country until the age of 13 when I moved to Ōtautahi/Christchurch.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Immediately following the earthquakes, I moved again. In Pōneke/Wellington I would work in restaurants and not long after, make plans to open one of my own.   </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>It’s hard to pin down my 'culture'. With so much upheaval it was hard to identify a specific, salient community. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>When I moved back to the South Island in 2013, I joined a raft of younger people remodelling the city post-quake. In doing so, I think I finally put down roots and found peers through collaboration  and the sharing of ideas. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Value-wise, my greatest influence would have to be my best friend. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>In high school we read heady 19th century philosophers and without a whiff of comprehension stitched together a mutt of a belief system we christened ‘Mediocre Nihilism’ (ignorant to the fact it was already invented, dubbed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review/"></a> Optimistic Nihilism </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>If nothing matters, embrace the absurd and find humour in all things (even the sombre). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>If everything is pointless, take a breath and reject the cynicism. Find beauty or excellence where you choose. Take interest in experience for its own sake. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Although you can’t prove they exist, others bring delight and you can be absolutely hedonistic in showing compassion, empathy and doing good deeds. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>“It's not naive or ignorant to choose to value little moments, small acts of kindness. In a world where so much can feel insignificant, choosing cruelty or hopelessness has no greater value than opting for kindness and empathy”</p>
