          <p>With the Core Studies taught at Dev Academy I think it’s most important to keep an open mind. You only get as much as you give. Personally, I’ve found I can only take on the lessons taught when I relinquish a little of my natural scepticism to the learnings and allow for the possibility of positive progress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>When I did, I noticed I could have a conversation with myself. Often, that voice only speaks up when it feels like taking a jab but by fully embracing a combination of the readings, mindfulness, and reflection that narrator was not only more accessible but kinder. I found that a lot of the issues I have struggled with my whole adult life aren’t novel and by virtue of that discovery, not impossible to overcome. Lastly, I was humbled by some of the materials. There are vast bodies of research on the problems I experience and because of that, their potential solutions. It’s hard to be all <em>woe is me</em> when there’s decades of work proving <em>it’s not personal</em>.</p>

          <h2>Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness<em></em></h2>
        </div>
        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Going into Dev Academy I specifically identified I didn’t have a strong value system or much of a cultural identity when asked. However, I’ve found with each following question surrounding the topic I have something to say. It’s hard to deny the existence of a value system when you can’t help but share a unique world-view when prompted. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>A learning environment can be a vulnerable place. Being aware of your own value system can help but, ultimately it is empathy that will prove the most disarming and necessary for the social cohesion required both when learning and in any future work environment. When one is encouraging, it is often met with contribution, when you show curiosity and listen, you’ll often discover a new perspective. When there is so much to gain from your colleagues a little empathy can’t be spared. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Self-awareness feeds into all of the above. These skills all compliment one another. Where I find it most useful though, is in self-diagnosis. <em>Am I struggling today because I’m not-smart, or is there more to the picture?</em> Both learning and programming can be <b>intense</b> and checking in with yourself once in a while can often lead to better, faster results than just cracking on. </p>

          <h2>Surprise! <em></em></h2>
        </div>
        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>As mentioned above, I’ve tuned in more effectively these past five weeks. In studying Core I have found values where I thought there were none and been humbled when pre-conceived notions were challenged. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p><em>Surprisingly</em>, in the process of shrugging off my inclination towards scepticism I found a study that actually recommended the opposite. In looking at behaviour patterns of those with high EQ it was found to be healthy as a natural response to strong emotions. Speaking of EQ, another surprise was how confronting some of the source material examples could be. At times it was if they had written the theoreticals using my non-existent diary as source material. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Lastly, core has helped me get a little more comfortable being uncomfortable. Whether that be speaking up in Zooms, admitting I need help or exposing myself to be “fully listened to” in the looping exercises. Whilst initially anxious, practise makes perfect and even if the little voice is convincing you will survive being a little vulnerable for a moment. </p>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Core wasn’t all self-actualisation and visions of a transcendental monk-like Louis. When I say I am a sceptic that’s ingrained. My natural resistance to anything labelled as mindfulness is truly inherent, a corner stone of my character. Getting over this wasn’t easy and I eventually sold myself on “just do the bare minimum” or “get it over and done with”. Whilst I could take a step forward by finding a unique situation that certainly was made easier by taking 5 minutes to breathe first, I would take another two backwards when I felt “I’ve been told this all before and it didn’t work then”. A few resources felt ted-talky in the “infotainment” way rather than ideas worth spreading ™, and any suspended disbelief would crash back to Earth. Like with the tech material, a short break can combat this shortcoming. Taking a moment to remind myself that the benefits are only available to those who participate I was able to overcome pessimism and engage with the material again.</p>

          <p>As Enspiral Dev Academy is not only an educator but also a jobs accelerator focused on practical skills, consulting industry was an important step in creating the curriculum. At the time Human Skills (or Core) wasn’t being taught and yet employers mentioned it was a requirement that was consistently not being met by applicants. Listening skills, team cohesion, effective collaboration are all necessary once a tech project graduates anywhere beyond the bedroom developer space. There was a gap between what the market was seeking and the training available at the time and human skills was folded into the learning material. </p>

        </div>
        <!-- PARAGRAPH ------------------------------->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I feel like a lot of the core skills taught have rehashed knowledge that I either already felt intuitively, had learnt through practise working in teams, or had worked on in therapy. There was an uncomfortable <em>same-same but different</em> vibe to a few of the materials. Because I have arrived at some of the same conclusions taught, when they’re stated plainly again it can feel facile. That said, the opportunity to employ and reaffirm so many individual concepts in such a short time period leaves me feeling that I’ve grown. Potentially at a faster pace than on my own in the past. I do feel a deeper connection and control over my inner voice which is something I’ve always struggled with. </p>
