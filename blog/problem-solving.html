          <p>When I was working on Kata 2 – Manipulating Objects, I forgot exactly that, how to manipulate objects.

Unfortunately, this means my productivity quickly wanes after lunch. Brute forcing syntax, everything I tried would not change Terah’s fertility status and I had only just written a blog about how to use <a href="https://doilyuser.github.io/blog/javascript-dom.html" target="_blank">dot notation</a>.</p>

            I reached out for help. A fellow student gently pointed to the .find() requirement of the exercise. I had either skimmed the question or totally skipped it, jumping into the index.test instead. After researching the method, why was I trying to use a loop anyway?

          <p>The Replit website may be useful for solving syntax issues, a missing pair of quotes or forgetting to add the word return at school, but I used the app to solve problems when I couldn't sit at my screen. I found it great for 'thinking outside of the box'. The human thumb has a limited bandwidth compared to a keyboard and a few monitors. Most of the kata's could be solved with only a few elegant lines of code and this limitation allowed me to break out of my habits of using loops and complicated if...else loops and think of smaller, more legible solutions.</p>
