          <h2>Learning? <em>Plan.</em></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>After 19 years working in hospitality and reaching the highest achievements within the occupation, I have become disenfranchised with the industry at large. The sector only thrives through rampant abuse of workers, spontaneous but constant harm to local communities, and promotion of alcohol - the most harmful drug widely available in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I opened my first restaurant, Civil & Naval, at 21. I am proud of my accomplishments as a young entrepreneur – and my reputation in the community as someone who cares deeply about employee well-being – but after selling my business last year I could not see a way to make significant positive change chasing further success in the field.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>That said, I do not have a clear vision for 2023, let alone the specifics of a future career path. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I know I want to create. That is what lead me to owning (at peak) three start-up sized business simultaneously. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I know I want to help, as the lack there-of is what motivated me to leave my previous profession and begin seeking anew. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I can be focused when a subject suits, to the point of obsession. In these moments of near tunnel-vision I can solve problems and acquire skills at the pace of a Harvard student cramming before finals. Even better, I’m actually enjoying myself. Even so, this can lead to me being <em>flaky.</em> Whilst I can throw myself in the deep end of curio,  as soon as the next fascination takes my attention I’ll throw the old karate gi or 5PC drumkit in storage. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I am a practical learner. I need to really <em>do</em> something in order to acquire understanding. I feel this a weakness most days until I complete a personal project that calcifies new knowledge permanently.  For this reason D.A. course materials presented in video or essay form have been challenging and I’ve had to invent my own homework. I do like that creating joke websites and pranking my partner with CTRL + SHIFT + i has lead to meeting my learning outcomes. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<em></em></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>In my 20s I thought myself invincible. For my 30th birthday life decided to bring me the gift of uncertainty, most would call it anxiety. I have been comfortable being myself as a well-off, cis-gendered, white man <em>(read: stale, pale, white, male)</em> for so long that reaching out for assistance is a such a foreign concept it may as well be another language <em>(although, it seems I’ve learnt two this week)</em>.  I don’t seek to fit the shoes of that arrogant 20-something-year-old  again, but I would like to find confidence again. This time, more helpful, sustainable, and based in reality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<em></em></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Despite moving around and attending more schools than I had years, my report cards were consistent. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p><em>“Louis can be loud”</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p><em>“Louis is a distraction”</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>When confronted, I mask with humour. Whether the challenge be educational, emotional, situational, ad infinitum. It’s a family tradition to ignore, obfuscate, and make light of the situation. At Dev Academy I intend to break this tradition. Not only shall I commit to not being distracted but more importantly, not distract others. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I solved a problem this week by sleeping on it. After going to bed at 2am I woke up the next morning having dreamed the solution. Whilst it was the first time I have dreamt in HTML I assume it won’t be the last time I dream in another language (namely, javascript). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I solved another by going outside on the Interislander. I had been going nowhere with a <em>.header</em> selector for nearly three hours when the captain announced there was a fire in main engine. We were evacuated to the balcony. Whilst nervous about my ability to swim I realised my ID tags were the problem. We made it to Picton and I made a resolution. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2><em>Take breaks.</em></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>At the screen I was running on a hamster wheel. Debugging is useless when missing the forest for the trees. Struggling over object fit: cover vs. contain is fruitless when the <div> is the problem.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I have learnt to take breaks, maybe Pomodoro had a point?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<em></em></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I have already struggled to ask for help. Mentioned previously, I have had a historical problem with arrogance. Mix that in with my new-found anxiety and we find a heady-cocktail of <em>“stubbornity”.</em> The two times I’ve reached out after struggling individually I I’ve been met with not only solutions, but a complete non-judgemental community. I have enjoyed answering fellow students questions. I should <em>interpret</em> that fellow cohorts feel the same but my anxieties have me <em>intuit</em> I’m alone. </p>
